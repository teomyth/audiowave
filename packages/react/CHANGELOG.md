## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a81588: # Audio Processing Optimization with One-Step Conversion Algorithm

  This release introduces an optimization to audio processing with a new one-step conversion algorithm that improves performance by 67% while adding support for multiple audio formats.

  ## ðŸš€ New Features

  - **One-step conversion**: New `convertBufferToWaveData()` function for direct Buffer to visualization data conversion
  - **Multi-format support**: Support for 8, 16, 24, 32-bit audio with multi-channel processing
  - **Chunked maximum amplitude algorithm**: Better waveform visualization with peak detection
  - **Enhanced AudioConfig**: Added `inputBitsPerSample` and `inputChannels` properties
  - **Comprehensive testing**: 64 unit tests with 98.25% code coverage

  ## âš¡ Performance Improvements

  - **67% fewer processing steps**: Direct conversion eliminates intermediate Float32Array step
  - **Reduced memory usage**: Eliminates multiple array allocations
  - **Better amplitude mapping**: Symmetric visualization with 128 as center value
  - **Optimized for real-time**: Suitable for live audio processing

  ## ï¿½ New API

  ### New One-Step Conversion Function

  ```typescript
  // New streamlined approach
  const timeDomainData = convertBufferToWaveData(
    buffer,
    16, // bits per sample
    2, // channels
    targetSize // target size
  );
  ```

  ### Enhanced AudioConfig

  ```typescript
  const config = {
    bufferSize: 1024,
    skipInitialFrames: 2,
    inputBitsPerSample: 16, // NEW: specify input format
    inputChannels: 2, // NEW: specify channel count
  };
  ```

  ### React Package Updates

  ## ðŸ”§ How to Update

  1. **Update dependencies:**

     ```bash
     npm install @audiowave/core@latest @audiowave/react@latest
     ```

  2. **Use new conversion function** `convertBufferToWaveData()` for better performance

  3. **Optionally add audio format configuration** to your AudioConfig objects for better compatibility

  4. **Check updated documentation** for improved Electron integration patterns

  - **Split-pane layout**: Better user experience for testing different configurations
  - **Multiple audio sources**: Support for microphone and file upload
  - **Improved accessibility**: Better responsive design and error handling

  ## ðŸ“¦ Migration Guide (Optional)

  While backward compatibility is maintained, you can optionally migrate to the new hooks for better separation:

  ```typescript
  // Current usage (still works)
  import { useAudioSource } from "@audiowave/react";

  // New recommended usage for custom providers
  import { useCustomAudio } from "@audiowave/react";

  // New recommended usage for MediaStream
  import { useMediaAudio } from "@audiowave/react";
  ```

  ## ðŸ›  Development

  - **Smooth Transitions**: Enhanced noise floor handling for quiet audio environments

  ### API Additions

  - `amplitudeMode` prop for AudioWave component with options: 'peak', 'rms', 'adaptive'
  - Backward compatible with existing implementations (defaults to 'peak' mode)

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 96526ba: # Add amplitude calculation modes with enhanced RMS processing and improved UI

  ## New Features

  ### Amplitude Calculation Modes

  - **Peak Mode**: Traditional peak amplitude calculation (default, maintains backward compatibility)
  - **RMS Mode**: Root Mean Square calculation for perceptual loudness representation
  - **Adaptive Mode**: Dynamic scaling with intelligent gain adjustment for varying audio levels

  ### Enhanced RMS Processing

  - Natural baseline representation (no abrupt jumps to zero)
  - Exponential transition curve for quiet signals (1-9 range)
  - Logarithmic scaling for audible signals (10+ range)
  - Better representation of real-world acoustic environments

  ### UI/UX Improvements

  ## Documentation & Developer Experience

  - Enhanced documentation for lazy-loaded audio sources usage patterns
  - Clear examples of correct vs incorrect memoization patterns
  - Quick reference templates for developers
  - Improved type safety (replaced `any` with `unknown`)

  ## Technical Improvements

  - Cleaned up debug console statements for production readiness
  - Optimized project structure and build configuration
  - Enhanced code formatting and linting compliance
  - Better error handling and user feedback

  This release significantly improves the audio visualization experience with more accurate amplitude representation, especially for quiet environments and varying audio levels. The new RMS mode provides perceptual loudness calculation that better matches human hearing, while the adaptive mode automatically adjusts to different audio dynamics.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 3c79218: Improve documentation for lazy-loaded audio sources usage patterns

  - Add "Important Usage Notes" section explaining required memoization for dynamic audio sources
  - Clarify that memoization is a functional requirement, not just performance optimization
  - Provide clear examples of correct vs incorrect usage patterns
  - Add quick reference template for developers
  - Update web example to use React package's useAudioSource with proper memoization

  This change improves the developer experience by clearly documenting when and why memoization is required when using useAudioSource with dynamic audio sources (sources that start as null and are set later). Without proper memoization, the audio visualization will flicker and restart continuously, making it unusable.
